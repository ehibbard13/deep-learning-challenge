# deep-learning-challenge

For this challeneg I wanted to mention that I tried multiple different options to try to preduce an accuracy score of 75% but seemed to get no closer than 72%. I added several different hidden layers and changed the node amounts and still could get no closer to 75%. Also, when saving the file to an HDF5 file I did run into any errors but I wasnt sure where to find the file or upload it to github. 

The files that were origionally used were provided by UW Madison. 

EDIT: Origionally I wasnt able to upload the hdf5 file but it is uploaded now. The FINALFINAL file is the final. Thank you!
